# Login Tests Readme

## Version:<br>
  - This code was published in iteration 2<br>

## Dependencies:<br>
  - The testing functions currently utilize Mocha and Chai to test out the js code
  -The testing functions can be found at “js_tests/test_scripts.js”
  -These testing scripts may change in the future once I utilize Django in my HTML files in future iterations
  -You do not need to install any dependencies to run the software
  -The following code runs in HTML5 so webpages like Safari may not be able to function properly.
  -Web browsers that disable cookies/cache will not be able to function properly

## How to Run It?<br>
  -Since this code is completely front-end based, you can simply click the “test_display.html” file located in the “Octogon_Login/js_tests” directory to run the tests. No builds required!
  -If any errors occur, it will be displayed to the user after clicking the html file
  -You may receive null errors from the test, this is to be expected
