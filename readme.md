# Project Octogon<br>

Octogon is a website that aims to provide a complete virtual classroom environment in which Students, TAs, and Professors can interact through an asynchronous messaging board. Unlike most platforms today, Octogon cultivates a professional, appealing classroom environment by limiting unwanted and oversaturated notifications. This allows Professors to stimulate relevant conversations, monitor and micromanage student interactions, and resolve student inquiries in a timely, non-intrusive manner.
